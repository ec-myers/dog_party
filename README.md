## Dog Party
### Summary

This is the first project of module one at the Turing School of Software & Design. Dog Party is an introduction to building 
websites based on comps provided by a designer. The recreation of these pages uses a single HTML file and two different stylesheets to create different layouts and styling.

The structure of these webpages does not utilize flexbox or grid and is not responsive at this time.

JavaScript functionality has been added to the form at the top of the page to allow the user to input their dog's name and update the text in the header above.

View the first comp live on github live pages: https://ec-myers.github.io/dog_party/
